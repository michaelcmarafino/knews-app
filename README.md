## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, CSS, JavaScript

React made building out this application very efficient and allowed me to implement many features in a short amount of time. It was great learning experience and allowed me to explore features of the library that I hadn't known much about. 

This definitely is not the last application I will be building using the React ecosystem and can see why it is so popular among my fellow engineers.

## Optimizations

I would refactor my code using a React framework like Next.js or Remix in order to improve performance and search engine optimization. In the future, I plan to add a backend api and database in order to have a place where an individual user's favorite stories can be stored.

## Lessons Learned:

How to implement the React library with its various tooling on a medium sized application. Using local storage, react router, the context API, CSS modules, framer motion, and react hooks to fetch data and make calls to certain APIs in order to build out a search page that allows the user to query this API.
